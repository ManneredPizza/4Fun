Here I'm gonna upload all the projects that I made just for fun, nothing serious

| Project       | Period        | Description  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| 3D rotations  | 12/2020 | I wanted to try, computationally, to understand why the average projected surface upon a plane is 1/4 of the original surface, later on I discovered the Cauchy's Surface Area Formula, generalization of what I was looking for (https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.05815) |
| Orari | 01/2021 | A very easy code to subtract minutes from a precise time, probably not the best way |
| Binomial | 02/2021 | Coding from the base the binomial distibution of an event |
